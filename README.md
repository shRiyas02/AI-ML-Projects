## 1. Cervical Cancer Risk Detection:
Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of cervical cancer can significantly improve the chances of successful treatment and save lives. This dataset help to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques to identify individuals at high risk of cervical cancer, allowing for timely intervention and medical care.
## 2. Hypothesis testing: 
Hypothesis testing in statistics uses sample data to infer the properties of a whole population. These tests determine whether a random sample provides sufficient evidence to conclude an effect or relationship exists in the population. They provide a structured approach to decision-making, emphasizing data-driven insights over personal biases or subjective opinions.
A hypothesis test evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a population to determine which statement the sample data best supports. These two statements are called the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. 
A hypothesis test evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a population to determine which statement the sample data best supports. These two statements are called the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. The following are typical examples:
Null Hypothesis: The effect does not exist in the population.
Alternative Hypothesis: The effect does exist in the population.
Hypothesis testing accounts for the inherent uncertainty of using a sample to draw conclusions about a population, which reduces the chances of false discoveries. These procedures determine whether the sample data are sufficiently inconsistent with the null hypothesis that you can reject it. If you can reject the null, your data favor the alternative statement that an effect exists in the population.
## 3. k-means clustering:
K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters. K means clustering, assigns data points to one of the K clusters depending on their distance from the center of the clusters. It starts by randomly assigning the clusters centroid in the space. Then each data point assign to one of the cluster based on its distance from centroid of the cluster. After assigning each point to one of the cluster, new cluster centroids are assigned. This process runs iteratively until it finds good cluster.

## 4. Principle Component analysis
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised learning algorithm technique used to examine the interrelations among a set of variables. It is also known as a general factor analysis where regression determines a line of best fit. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of a data set by finding a new set of variables, smaller than the original set of variables, retaining most of the sampleâ€™s information, and useful for the regression and classification of data.

## 5. K-Nearest Neighbour Analysis
The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point. It is one of the popular and simplest classification and regression classifiers used in machine learning.
