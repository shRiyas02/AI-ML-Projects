#1. Cervical Cancer Risk Detection:
Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of cervical cancer can significantly improve the chances of successful treatment and save lives. This dataset help to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques to identify individuals at high risk of cervical cancer, allowing for timely intervention and medical care.
#2. Hypothesis testing: Hypothesis testing in statistics uses sample data to infer the properties of a whole population. These tests determine whether a random sample provides sufficient evidence to conclude an effect or relationship exists in the population. They provide a structured approach to decision-making, emphasizing data-driven insights over personal biases or subjective opinions.
# A hypothesis test evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a population to determine which statement the sample data best supports. These two statements are called the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. 
A hypothesis test evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a population to determine which statement the sample data best supports. These two statements are called the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. The following are typical examples:
Null Hypothesis: The effect does not exist in the population.
Alternative Hypothesis: The effect does exist in the population.
Hypothesis testing accounts for the inherent uncertainty of using a sample to draw conclusions about a population, which reduces the chances of false discoveries. These procedures determine whether the sample data are sufficiently inconsistent with the null hypothesis that you can reject it. If you can reject the null, your data favor the alternative statement that an effect exists in the population.
